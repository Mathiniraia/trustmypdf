            Please read these Terms of Service carefully before using the Trust My PDF website and services operated by Trust My PDF.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
          <p>
            By accessing or using our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the service.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
          <p>
            Trust My PDF provides a suite of web-based utility tools for managing, editing, combining, and optimizing Portable Document Format (PDF) files. The core processing is performed entirely within your web browser, meaning your files are not transmitted to or stored on our servers.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
          <p>
            While certain features are available for free (subject to daily limits), advanced features and unlimited access require a "Pro" subscription.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Billing:</strong> You will be billed in advance on a recurring, periodic basis (such as monthly or annually), depending on the subscription plan you select.</li>
            <li><strong>Cancellations:</strong> You may cancel your subscription at any time. Your access will remain active until the end of your current billing cycle.</li>
            <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> Except when required by law, paid subscription fees are non-refundable. We encourage users to utilize the free tier to test the tools before purchasing a Pro plan.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
          <p>
            You agree not to use Trust My PDF:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>In any way that violates any applicable national or international law or regulation.</li>
            <li>To attempt to bypass or reverse engineer the paywall, rate limits, or proprietary code.</li>
            <li>To engage in any automated use of the system, such as using scripts to send multiple requests beyond normal human usage, without prior written permission via API access.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
          <p>
            The website and its original content, features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of Trust My PDF and its licensors. Our branding, logos, and UI designs may not be used in connection with any product or service without the prior written consent of Trust My PDF.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>
            In no event shall Trust My PDF, nor its directors, employees, or partners, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because we do not store your files, we are not liable for any data loss regarding your PDFs. Please ensure you maintain original copies of all documents you process.
          </p>
